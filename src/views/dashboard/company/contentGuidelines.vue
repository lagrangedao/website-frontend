          Code of Conduct
        </router-link> which gives a general overview and states our standards and how we wish the community will behave.</p>

      <p>Lagrange's purpose is to help the Lagrange Community work together to advance
        <strong>Open</strong>,
        <strong>Collaborative</strong>, and
        <strong>Responsible</strong> Machine Learning. Lagrange's achievements are only possible thanks to the awesome Community on our Platform.</p>
      <p>We value these relationships and aim to maintain an environment where people feel welcome and supported and get the most out of their contributions and experiences. Therefore, we created the following Content Guidelines and Policy (these
        "Guidelines") for our Platform and its Users.</p>
      <p>These Guidelines aim to outline Lagrange's actions to protect our Community on our Platform. Our goal is to enable our Community to flag types of Content with a higher risk of harming people so we may give it extra scrutiny according to
        the Guidelines that follow.</p>
      <p>Please
        <strong>read these Guidelines</strong> as they contain important information about the Content we authorize to be posted on our Platform.</p>
      <p>These Guidelines are a policy incorporated into our Terms of Service, which is a
        <strong>binding agreement</strong> between us and you. You should also carefully review all of our other guidelines, policies, and documents available on our Website, including our

          <p>
            <strong>"Community Content"</strong>: Content that can be found in the Community section of the Lagrange Platform, including discussions, comments, and usernames, as well as related documentation such as READMEs, model cards, data cards,
            pull requests, and merges.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>"Community"</strong> refers to all Users of the Lagrange Platform, including Lagrange personnel.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>"Community Tab"</strong> refers to a collaborative feature where the Community can discuss specific Repositories, including providing feedback, brainstorming ideas and opening pull requests for improvements.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>"Lagrange"</strong> refers to Lagrange Inc., which may perform its obligations through its affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents and/or employees.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>"Platform"</strong> or
        <strong>"Lagrange Hub"</strong>, or
        <strong>"Hub"</strong> refers to the hosting platform where Users can build, benchmark, share, version and deploy Repositories, which may include Models, Datasets and Machine Learning Applications.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>"Repository"</strong> refers to a data structure which contains all of the project files and the entire revision history.</p>
      <p>A Repository may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>"Public"</strong>: anyone on the internet can see it, but only you or members of your organization can make changes;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>"Private"</strong>: only you or members of your organization can see and make changes to the Repository; New Users need to join the maintaining organization in order to both see the Repository and access its Content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>"Gated"</strong>: Gated Repositories and their Community Content are visible to everyone, but access to their ML artifacts (data, model weights) requires either accepting conditions in a click-through form or approval by the Repository
            maintainers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>"Repository Label"</strong> refers to a label assigned to a Repository. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>"Not For All Audiences" (NFAA)</strong>: Content that Lagrange or the Repository's authors have determined may not be suitable for all Community members, e.g., sexual Content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>"Team"</strong> or
        <strong>"Lagrange Team"</strong> refers to Lagrange personnel.</p>
      <h2 id="üïµÔ∏è-how-do-we-assess-whether-content-follows-our-guidelines">üïµÔ∏è How do we assess whether Content follows our Guidelines?</h2>
      <p>These Guidelines address two categories of content.</p>
      <p>Some Content is deemed broadly inappropriate for the Platform, and will be removed and may lead to further consequences for the Users depending on severity. Such Content is covered in the üôÖ&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è
        <strong>Restricted Content</strong> section and will usually be addressed directly by the Lagrange Team.</p>
      <p>Some Content requires an iterative approach to determine whether and under what conditions it may be hosted on the Platform. Such Content is covered in the ü§ù
        <strong>Moderated Content</strong> section and will usually be addressed in collaboration with both the Repository owner and any concerned party, as part of our decision-making process. Direct interaction fosters communication and clarification
        among interested parties, and consequently, might improve the Repository's code and documentation quality. The three main aspects we will pay attention to are: the
        <strong>origin of the ML artifact</strong>,
        <strong>how the ML artifact is handled by its developers</strong>, and
        <strong>how the ML artifact has been used</strong>.</p>
      <h3 id="üôÖ‚ôÇÔ∏è-restricted-content">üôÖ&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è Restricted Content</h3>
      <p>We do not tolerate the following Content on our Platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Unlawful, defamatory, fraudulent or intentionally deceptive Content, including, but not limited to coordinated or other inauthentic behavior, disinformation, phishing or scams;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that harms others;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content promoting discrimination, or hate speech;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content harassing, demeaning, or bullying;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sexual content used or created for harassment, bullying, or without explicit consent of the people represented;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All sexual content involving minors;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that promotes or glorifies violence or the suffering or humiliation of another;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that promotes or induces unlawful or fraudulent currencies, securities, investments, or other transactions;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content published without the explicit consent of the people represented;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Spam, such as advertising a product or service, or excessive bulk activity;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cryptomining practices;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that infringes or violates any rights of a third party or an applicable License;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that violates the privacy of a third party;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that violates any applicable law or regulation;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that attempts to transmit or generate code that is designed to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorized access to a computer system or device;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that is malware, a trojan horse or virus, or other malicious code;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content that promotes high-risk activities, included but not limited to, weapons development, self-harm, suicide, gambling, plagiarism, scams or pseudo-pharmaceuticals.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any Content not listed above that requires our attention, we will decide on a case-by-case basis whether it is to be restricted or whether it is to be moderated as described in the following section.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if we become aware that personal information belonging to individuals below the age of 13 has been collected without parental consent, we will take appropriate action to remove this data from our Platform (see ¬ß 7 of our Privacy
        Policy).
      </p>
      <h3 id="ü§ù-moderated-content">ü§ù Moderated Content</h3>
      <p>In addition to Restricted Content,
        <strong>Moderated Content</strong> may warrant extra scrutiny and is handled through a collaborative iterative approach that allows us to classify the Content and respond accordingly. This includes Content that has a higher risk of causing harm,
        such as Content with strong dual use potential, or Content whose legal status depends on the specifics of how it is shared, among others. Content that is reported by the Community on such grounds using the community flagging feature
        (see below) triggers the moderation process.</p>
      <p>To guide this iterative process, we hold
        <strong>consent as a core value</strong>. While existing regulations do protect people's rights to work, image, and data, new ways of processing information enabled by Machine Learning technology are posing new questions with respect to these
        rights. In this evolving legal landscape, prioritizing consent not only supports forethought and more empathy towards stakeholders but also encourages proactive measures to address cultural and contextual factors.</p>
      <p>We prioritize
        <strong>collaborative solutions</strong> for both ML Artifacts and Community Content (see definitions above) that involve the owner of the Repository whenever possible, especially in cases where modifications or additional guardrails can help
        the Content meet the Guidelines.</p>
      <h3 id="ü§ñ-ml-artifacts">ü§ñ ML Artifacts</h3>
      <p>When Content is reported, we typically allow approximately 72 hours for the Repository owner to respond. In case of non-engagement or other circumstances, the Lagrange Team may trigger unilateral actions. Specifically, we identify two
        levels of intervention:</p>
      <p>A.
        <strong>Community features</strong>: in order to reduce the risk of problematic outcomes, we may require Users sharing Content to leverage the following three mechanisms. These are not necessarily sequential and can be required independently
        or in conjunction. For transparency, discussions occur in the public Community tab.</p>

      <p>B.
        <strong>"Not-for-all-Audiences" tag</strong>: out of consideration for other Users of the Hub, we request you flag applicable Content via the "Not For All Audiences" tag and in the Repository's card metadata, as it will allow Users of the Hub
        to choose whether they see it or not by default. The Lagrange Team may also tag the at-issue Repositories of Content if they meet any of the following criteria.</p>
      <p> Flagged content should include, but should not be limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Un-requested sexual Content</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determining whether the Content is "sexual" can be subjective, cultural, and context-dependent. However, criteria include but are not limited to:
              <ul>
                <li>Depictions of nudity or partial nudity that are sexually suggestive or arousing to the viewer</li>
                <li>Sexual topics or themes, such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pornography and soft porn</li>
                    <li>Hentai and/or ecchi</li>

      </ul>
      <p>C.
        <strong>Lagrange tools</strong>: when an ML Artifact is deemed to pose too high a risk even with the above guardrails, the Lagrange Team may take direct action. The following three actions are not necessarily sequential and can occur independently.
        Discussion of these actions takes place in the Community tab.</p>

      <p>We encourage
        <strong>collective responsibility</strong> in order to maintain a healthy and thriving Community. The
        <strong>Community Tab</strong> allows you to bring issues to the attention of the Community by opening discussions within each Repository, proposing Pull Requests to modify its Content, and suggesting ways to address the problems. If you encounter
        harmful Content, you can directly flag it via the
        <strong>"Report" button</strong> on the Hub. This action will open a public discussion in the Community Tab and ping the Lagrange Team, who will act accordingly to the given rules.</p>
      <p>In addition, in some situations, the
        <strong>Lagrange Team may flag Content</strong> to reflect requests or concerts expressed through other channels (e.g., via email or social media). Depending on the severity of the issue we may leverage the mechanisms described above, while
        remaining active in moderating the communication as mediators between different entities involved.</p>
      <p>Finally, please note that
        <strong>reports are Community Content</strong> and are themselves subject to these Guidelines. Abusive uses of the flagging feature, including but not limited to spamming or harassment, will not be tolerated.</p>
